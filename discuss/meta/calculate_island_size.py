Here's a neatly formatted question based on your code:

### Problem Statement: Largest New Island

You are given a **2D grid** where:
- `1` represents land (part of an existing island).
- `0` represents water (empty space).

Your task is to determine the size of the **largest new island** you can form by converting exactly one water cell (`0`) into land (`1`), while following these rules:

1. **Isolated Placement**: The newly formed land cannot be adjacent (including diagonally) to any existing land cell (`1`).
2. **Island Size**: The size of an island is the total number of connected `1`s, either horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).
3. **Output**: Return the size of the largest possible island you can create.

---

### Example

#### Input:
```python
grid = [
    [1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1]
]
```

#### Output:
```plaintext
1
```

#### Explanation:
- Only water cell `(1,1)` can be converted to land, forming a new isolated island of size `1`.

---

### Approach

The function should:
1. Loop through all `0` cells in the grid.
2. Validate that the cell is not adjacent to any existing `1`.
3. Simulate turning the cell into land and calculate the size of the resulting island using **DFS**.
4. Track and return the largest island size found.
